This website was created to share the details of the life and happiness of my female cat, Sydney, who has

​      just turned one year old. However, as a new cat lover, it is more meaningful to share the joy and knowledge

​      necessary for new cat owners.

Therefore, we hope that while you can enjoy the cats, you can also acquire some interesting and practical

​      tips on cat ownership, which may come in handy someday.

## Reflection

  Before studying web design, I had a very vague idea of how to create a web page, thinking that the whole process was similar to JAVA, a programming language that requires extremely complex code combinations, and that no one had any idea of how to create a web page on their own. After a semester of study, I realised that web design is not as complicated as I thought. To create a simple web page, all you need is a little bit of basic front-end typography skills and an understanding of the basic structure of web HTML. Of course, if you want to design a web page with a variety of functions and a smooth interface style, you need to have a rich knowledge base.

During this course, I learnt about Javascript and CSS in addition to the basic HTML writing conventions and syntax. I used HTML to set up the basic framework of the website, then used CSS to add some fonts and colours to beautify the pages and to unify the style of the website. In Assignment2, I learnt and used Javascript, which gave me the possibility to provide more interaction for the user, and Javascrpit to provide some dynamic effects that are difficult to do with CSS and improve the user experience.

My website design assignments this term have all been on the theme of cats, and I will then talk about my understanding of website creation, using my own assignments as examples.

① Determining website requirements: Define the website objectives, functions and audience (e.g. cats), which

​      will help determine the required technology and design direction.

②Planning the structure of the website: creating the information architecture of the website, including page

​      hierarchy, navigation and content organisation.

③Designing the appearance of the website: The appearance of the website should be uniform in style, mainly in

​      terms of font and background color, to give the user a comfortable look and feel.

④Develop the website functionality: choose the appropriate development technology according to the needs,

​      first using HTML to build the basic framework, and then complement it with CSS and Javascrpit.

⑤ Creating website content: writing and organising the text, images, video and other media content required

​      for the website, then linking it to where it needs to be displayed, and finally carrying out simple tests to

​      ensure there are no display problems by logging in to your own pages on different devices.

## Cat Feeding

Feeding a cat can be a straightforward process. As a newbie, here are some basic tips to ensure your cat

​    gets the proper nutrition it needs:

①Choose a high-quality cat food: Look for cat food that is specifically formulated for your cat's life stage and

​    needs. Read the ingredients label carefully to ensure that the food contains high-quality protein sources,

​    vitamins, and minerals.

②Determine the appropriate feeding amount: The amount of food your cat needs will depend on its age, size, and

​    activity level. Follow the feeding guidelines on the cat food packaging, but adjust as needed based on your

​    cat's individual needs.

  ③Feed your cat on a regular schedule: Cats thrive on routine, so establish a feeding schedule and stick to it.

​    Most cats do well with two meals a day.

  ④Provide fresh water: Make sure your cat has access to clean, fresh water at all times. Change the water daily

​    and clean the bowl regularly.

⑤Avoid giving your cat human food: While it may be tempting to share your food with your cat, many human foods

​    can be harmful to cats. Stick to feeding your cat cat-specific food.

⑥Monitor your cat's weight: Regularly monitor your cat's weight and adjust its food intake as necessary. An

​    overweight cat can develop health problems, so it's important to keep your cat at a healthy weight.

## Cat Bathing

Bathing a cat can be a challenging task, as most cats do not enjoy being wet or groomed. However, if your

​    cat has gotten into something dirty or has fleas, bathing may be necessary. Here are some tips for a newbie on

​    how to bathe a cat:

①Gather supplies: You will need a cat-specific shampoo, towels, a washcloth, and a pitcher or handheld

​    showerhead. Place these items within easy reach before you begin.

②Brush your cat: Before you start the bath, brush your cat's fur to remove any tangles or mats. This will make

​    it easier to lather the shampoo and rinse your cat's coat thoroughly.

  ③Fill the tub or sink with warm water: Fill the tub or sink with enough warm water to submerge your cat up to

​    its belly. Be sure to test the water temperature with your elbow or wrist to ensure it is not too hot or too

​    cold.

  ④Wet your cat: Use a pitcher or handheld showerhead to wet your cat's fur thoroughly. Be careful not to get

​    water in your cat's ears or face.

  ⑤Lather with shampoo: Apply a small amount of cat-specific shampoo to your cat's fur, starting at the neck and

​    working your way down to the tail. Avoid the face and ears. Massage the shampoo into your cat's fur, adding more

​    as needed.

​    ⑥Rinse thoroughly: Rinse your cat's fur thoroughly with warm water, ensuring that all of the shampoo is removed.

​    You may need to use a washcloth to clean any hard-to-reach areas.

  ⑦Dry your cat: Wrap your cat in a towel and gently pat its fur to remove excess water. You may need to use

​    several towels to dry your cat completely. Avoid using a hair dryer, as the noise and heat can scare your cat.

## Playing With Cat

Playing with your cat is not only fun, but it also provides exercise and mental stimulation, which is

​    important for their overall health and wellbeing. Here are some tips for a newbie on how to play with their cat:

①Choose the right toys: Cats have different preferences when it comes to toys, so try out a few different types

​    to see what your cat likes. Some popular options include feather wands, balls, and toy mice.

  ②Set aside dedicated playtime: Set aside a few minutes each day to play with your cat. This will help establish

​    a routine and ensure that your cat gets the exercise and mental stimulation they need.

  ③Let your cat take the lead: Follow your cat's cues when playing. Some cats prefer chasing toys, while others

​    enjoy pouncing or batting at them. Let your cat take the lead and adapt your play style accordingly.

④Use interactive toys: Interactive toys, such as puzzle feeders or treat-dispensing balls, can provide mental

​    stimulation and encourage your cat to be more active.

  ⑤Keep it safe: Always supervise your cat during playtime and ensure that any toys you use are safe and free of

​    small parts that could be swallowed.

⑥End on a positive note: End playtime on a positive note by giving your cat a treat or a favorite toy to play

​    with on their own.
