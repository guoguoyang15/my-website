		<p>

			Before studying web design, I had a very vague idea of how to create a web page, thinking that the whole
			process was similar to JAVA, a programming language that requires extremely complex code combinations, and
			that no one had any idea of how to create a web page on their own. After a semester of study, I realised
			that web design is not as complicated as I thought. To create a simple web page, all you need is a little
			bit of basic front-end typography skills and an understanding of the basic structure of web HTML. Of course,
			if you want to design a web page with a variety of functions and a smooth interface style, you need to have
			a rich knowledge base.

	<h1 style="text-align: center;">What I've learned besides HTML</h1> <!-- style here is the height of the text -->

	<div class="introduction_homepage">

		<p>
			During this course, I learnt about Javascript and CSS in addition to the basic HTML writing conventions and
			syntax. I used HTML to set up the basic framework of the website, then used CSS to add some fonts and
			colours to beautify the pages and to unify the style of the website. In Assignment2, I learnt and used
			Javascript, which gave me the possibility to provide more interaction for the user, and Javascrpit to
			provide some dynamic effects that are difficult to do with CSS and improve the user experience.

		<p>
			My website design assignments this term have all been on the theme of cats, and I will then talk about my
			understanding of website creation, using my own assignments as examples.

		</p>
		<p>① Determining website requirements: Define the website objectives, functions and audience (e.g. cats), which
			will help determine the required technology and design direction.

		</p>
		<p>②Planning the structure of the website: creating the information architecture of the website, including page
			hierarchy, navigation and content organisation.

		</p>
		<p>③Designing the appearance of the website: The appearance of the website should be uniform in style, mainly in
			terms of font and background colour, to give the user a comfortable look and feel.

		</p>
		<p>④Develop the website functionality: choose the appropriate development technology according to the needs,
			first using HTML to build the basic framework, and then complement it with CSS and Javascrpit.

		</p>
		<p>⑤ Creating website content: writing and organising the text, images, video and other media content required
			for the website, then linking it to where it needs to be displayed, and finally carrying out simple tests to
			ensure there are no display problems by logging in to your own pages on different devices.

	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Some ideas for improving your own web design</h1>
	<!-- style here is the height of the text -->

	<div class="introduction_homepage">



		<p>I scored 8.75 on my A1 and 10 on my A2, so here are my main ideas for improving my A1.</p>
		<p>The CSS in A1 scored 0.75, I think my style needs to be improved, there are too many font styles on the
			webpage and should be unified in style, in addition, the whole webpage lacks enough CSS colour styles, which
			makes the website look rather spartan.</p>
		<p>A1's Site Map scored 0.5 points, similar to the previous deduction for CSS. My web map design is too minimal,
			just satisfying the basic functions and not well presented, and does not look intuitive enough.</p>
		<p>A1 scored 0.75 for the quality of the site, mainly because my homepage was too cluttered. I put many photos
			of my cat's life on the homepage, but did not do a good job of layout, which resulted in the page only
			displaying properly at 100% zoom, otherwise the layout would have been faulty.</p>
		<p>A1 scored 0.75 for Coding, this was because I did not add enough notes, which resulted in poor readability of
			the coding of the page.</p>
